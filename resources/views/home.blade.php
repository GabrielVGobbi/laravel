                    <h1>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring
                        which I enjoy with my whole heart.</h1>

                    I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I
                    neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I
                    feel that I never was a greater artist than now.

                    When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper
                    surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner
                    sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the
                    earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the
                    stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel
                    the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath.
